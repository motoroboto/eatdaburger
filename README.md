A Full Stack web app that allows you to order a burger and then consume it. It will also keep track of burgers that you have already eaten. It was built using mySql and an express framework. The dynamicly updating bootstrap layout utilizes handlebars. You can view the app on [Heroku](https://motorobotoeatdaburger.herokuapp.com).

If you would like to run it yourself you can clone this repository to your local device and run an '-npm install'. After it has been initialized you can use the included schema and seed files to create a database. After the database us running use the '-node server.js' command to run the app and then you can connect to it on localhost 3000.
